# Rasterman

Rasterman is a small application to enlarge bitmaps by converting them into rasterized scalable vector graphics to be used as posters. The software is  inspired by [The Rasterbator](https://rasterbator.net/), an application created in 2004 by Matias Ã„rje. All kudos go to him. Whereas Rasterbator's standalone version is implemented in C# and comes with a small GUI, Rasterman is programmed in C++ and uses the Qt 6.8.1 framework. The reason why I developed of Rasterman is Qt. I wanted to learn the framework and was I looking for something interesting and easy to develop. Currently Renderman is available as console application only. But I'm planning to give it a GUI too and to run it in Linux and in Windows. The current version is Linux-only.

To compile it you'll need Qt 6.8.1 which can be downloaded at https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss.

The command line arguments and options are self-explaining:

```
$ ./rasterman -h
Usage: ./rasterman [options] input
Converts a bitmap file into a rasterized, scalable vector graphic.

Arguments:
  input                      Input file
