# Rasterman

Rasterman is a small application to enlarge bitmaps by converting them into rasterized scalable vector graphics to be used as posters. The software is heavily inspired by [The Rasterbator](https://rasterbator.net/), a similar application created by Matias Ã„rje in 2004. Whereas Rasterbator's standalone version is implemented in C# and comes with a GUI Rasterman is programmen in C++ using the Qt 6.8.1 framework and is a console application only. The reason behind the development of Rasterman is Qt. I wanted to learn the framework and was looking for something interesting to develop.
